THere are 3 different connectors, the last you will receive will probably be the bigger one.

It has changed in terms of internal wire for the power, seems to be 18 awg now.

But the connector is different and since its needed a modified version of the Canbus Cable holder.

I had to slightly retouch the CW2 bridge, so that it matches better with the USB-c and therefore the entire assembly of the cable holder.
